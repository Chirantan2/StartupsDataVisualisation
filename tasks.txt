Visualize data using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. 

✓    Load the data set provided into pandas. 

✓    Understand the dataset and perform descriptive statistics(mean, standard deviation, etc..) 

✓    Check for missing data and perform cleaning if necessary.e.g  

✓    Use .info(), .isna() to check for missing or NaN data and remove those records from the dataframe. Use methods like replacing NaN values with mean/median of the column or estimate NaN values based on neighbouring data points. 

✓    Explore relationships between pairs of features using scatter plots and pair plots. 

✓    What are the different states where the startups are located? Provide a count of startups in each state. 

✓    Calculate the total and average profit generated by startups in each state. 

✓    Visualize the distribution of profits among the startups using a histogram. 

✓    Compare the average R&D spend, administration spend, and marketing spend among the startups located in different states. 

✓    Compute the correlation matrix between R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and profit. 

    Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap. 

✓    Determine which expenditure (R&D, administration, or marketing) has the highest correlation with profit. 

    Note: Use any library Matplotlib, Seaborn or Plotly which is best suited.
